The objective of this project is to eradicate the use of the traditional fingerprint attendance
system and make the current facial recognition system which doesnâ€™t need you to stand in front
of an instrument for over 5-10 seconds which mostly use Eigen Face, (Haar Cascade for the face
coordinates) method. The fingerprint scanners will no longer be used post-COVID era. This deep
learning based attendance system is so fast that it will check you in even if you just pass by the
camera that is that it just takes less than a second to identify you and mark your presence. It can
handle multiple faces in a single frame and mark the attendance which traditional facial
recognition attendance systems can not do. The deep learning model used in this report is
FaceNet from Google.
